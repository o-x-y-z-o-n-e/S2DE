# S2DE
S2DE stand for "SDL 2D Extensions" or "Simple Direct Layer, Two Dimensions, Extensions". It doesn't really do what it implies it does though.
S2DE is a game framework library specifically designed for 2D "pixel" games. It uses SDL2 as it's core. This is in very early development and I only work on it in my free time.
